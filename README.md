# Geophone Sensor Data Analysis for Movement Detection

This project presents a data-collection, processing, and machine-learning workflow using geophone (vibration) sensor data to detect and classify human movement patterns. The aim is to explore wearable or ambient sensor technologies for biomechanics, rehabilitation, and prosthetic/assistive device feedback.

## 📋 Project Overview  
- **Sensor Data Source:** Geophone sensors (vibration/ground motion) collected during human movement activities (walking, running, waiting, etc.).  
- **Preprocessing:** Filtering, segmentation into fixed-length windows, normalization, and extraction of time- and frequency-domain features.  
- **Modeling:** Trained classical machine-learning models (Random Forest, SVM) on the extracted features.  
- **Goal:** Develop a robust pipeline to classify motion patterns via geophone signal analysis, demonstrating the potential of non-traditional sensors in wearable/ambient applications.
